# Publish Blog

This is a utility I wrote to automate publishing an obsidian file into my blog.

What it does is copy paste files from the obsidian vault into your blog directory, and then run some pre-specified shell commands for you.

Hopefully, it saves you some time from not having to manually copy paste stuff.

[Also, thanks to the people at Obsidian!](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Release+your+plugin+with+GitHub+Actions)
